# Privacy-Preserving KYC Verification System

A modern ZKP identity verification system demonstrating secure credential sharing.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This project uses **Firebase** for shared proof storage, allowing the Verifier Dashboard to validate proofs generated by the User Dashboard.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm

### Installation

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd privacy-kyc-system
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser to the URL shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## 🔐 Credentials

**User Dashboard (Prover):**
- Email: `user@demo.com`
- Password: `123456`

**Verifier Dashboard:**
- ID: `BankDemo`
- Password: `123456`

## 🧩 Features

- **Zero-Knowledge Proof Generation**: Select attributes (Age, Residency) and generate a proof.
- **Firebase Integration**: Proofs are securely stored in Firestore, enabling real-time verification across different sessions/devices.
- **Verifier Dashboard**: Verify Proof IDs and see the result (Valid/Invalid) without seeing PII.
- **Glassmorphism UI**: Modern, secure-feeling interface with Tailwind CSS.
- **Bank Portal**: Simulated 3rd party integration demonstrating the "Login with ZKP" flow.

## ⚠️ Architecture Note
While this system uses Firebase to store proof metadata for the demonstration, a production ZKP system would verify the cryptographic proof on-chain or via a dedicated verifier service without storing the proof metadata in a centralized DB like this. This setup simulates the *verification flow* user experience.
